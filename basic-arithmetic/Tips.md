**Tip:** Reposition only (see `Reposition Queries.txt`). Do not randomize.

This should help the material to stick easier, as each additional knowledge
will immediately be reinforced by the most recent ones, building a single
coherent memory structure. See, <https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules>
