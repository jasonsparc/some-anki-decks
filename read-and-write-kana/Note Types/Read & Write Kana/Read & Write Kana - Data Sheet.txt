あ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_a.mp3]	a		"In <i>a</i>, it&rsquo;s important that the last stroke intersects the two places I have circled on the left. Notice, also, that the very end of the last stroke is &ldquo;trying&rdquo; to finish a complete circle. In other words, don&rsquo;t make it pointing down or some other direction."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_a.png"">"
い	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_i.mp3]	i		"Your main concern with <i>i</i> should be including the <i>hane</i>. Create it with a light flick of your pencil, much like you might make a check mark. Also notice that the second stroke is not as long as the first."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_i.png"">"
う	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_u.mp3]	u		"With <i>u</i>, be sure you angle the first stroke back, not making it a vertical line. Also, make sure that you start stroke two by veering northeast."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_u.png"">"
え	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_e.mp3]	e		"To make <i>e</i> look good, be sure to get the wave in at the end."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_e.png"">"
お	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_o.mp3]	o		"In <i>o</i>, notice how you can see the energy being directed to the final stroke. Follow this flow to keep the character fluid and great-looking."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_o.png"">"
か	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ka.mp3]	ka		"When you write <i>ka</i>, try to keep it balanced inside a triangle formed by the second and third strokes. The first stroke comes down in the center of the triangle, parallel to the next stroke."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ka.png"">"
き	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ki.mp3]	ki		You can place the last stroke correctly in <i>ki</i> if you imagine an oval sitting inside as shown here.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ki.png"">"
く	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ku.mp3]	ku		"With <i>ku</i>, just keep the angle to about 90 degrees, perhaps a bit more, and you&rsquo;ll be good."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ku.png"">"
け	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ke.mp3]	ke		"In <i>ke</i>, be sure to include a good <i>hane</i> at the end of stroke one. Also, notice that this character looks very good if you veer to the left at the end of stroke three, as shown here by the arrow."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ke.png"">"
こ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ko.mp3]	ko		Your main concern with <i>ko</i> should be to keep it from looking like an equals sign. You can do this by honoring the <i>hane</i> at the end of the first stroke and by keeping the two strokes far enough apart to imagine a square sitting between them.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ko.png"">"
さ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_sa.mp3]	sa		"As with <i>ki</i>, imagine an oval sitting inside <i>sa</i> to help place the final stroke."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_sa.png"">"
し	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_shi.mp3]	shi		"Don&rsquo;t make <i>shi</i> look like a fishhook. You can avoid this by making the end of it point off at a 45-degree angle, not straight up."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_shi.png"">"
す	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_su.mp3]	su		"Just as in <i>ke</i>, this character looks the best when the final stroke veers to the left at the end. Also, keep the loop nice and open. Japanese people often exaggerate it, so don&rsquo;t worry about making it too large."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_su.png"">"
せ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_se.mp3]	se		"Besides being careful about the <i>hane</i> as always, note that the first stroke runs uphill very slightly."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_se.png"">"
そ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_so.mp3]	so		<i>So</i> can be a hard character to write nicely. One thing that can really make a difference is opening up that last curve. Imagine there&rsquo;s a plump oval sitting in there.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_so.png"">"
た	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ta.mp3]	ta		You&rsquo;ll notice that there is a small <i>ko</i> inside this character. Give the mini-<i>ko</i> the same <i>hane</i> it gets in its grown-up version.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ta.png"">"
ち	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_chi.mp3]	chi		"In <i>chi</i>, be sure that the round part of the last stroke starts by veering up slightly, as shown by the arrow."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_chi.png"">"
つ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tsu.mp3]	tsu		<i>Tsu</i> is easy to remember if you imagine the breaking wave of a <i>tsunami</i>.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_tsu.png"">"
て	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_te.mp3]	te		Keep <i>te</i> from looking like a 7 by imagining that a large plump ball is sitting in the curve.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_te.png"">"
と	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_to.mp3]	to		"I think the standard way to remember <i>to</i> is to think of someone&rsquo;s big toe. If you keep that second stroke open enough to actually put a toe inside, it will look nice."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_to.png"">"
な	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_na.mp3]	na		"When writing this character, note that the third stroke veers to the right ever so slightly. If you swing it out just a bit there, it makes a big difference in the balance of the character."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_na.png"">"
に	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ni.mp3]	ni		<i>Ni</i> is similar to <i>ta</i> in that the last two strokes should not be quite parallel. Taking this one simple precaution really helps the look of this character.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ni.png"">"
ぬ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_nu.mp3]	nu		"My main advice for <i>nu</i> is that you make the first stroke long enough that the second will intersect it and leave a little hanging over, as I&rsquo;ve shown in red."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_nu.png"">"
ね	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ne.mp3]	ne		"<i>Ne</i> doesn&rsquo;t look good when people confuse it with <i>nu</i> and make the first stroke diagonal. Bring it straight down, nice and strong."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ne.png"">"
の	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_no.mp3]	no		"The main thing to notice in <i>no</i> is how perfect an oval it is. When you lift up your pencil at the end, you should be able to see little dashed lines in your imagination that close the circle."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_no.png"">"
は	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ha.mp3]	ha		"With <i>ha</i>, just be sure to get the <i>hane</i> at the end of stroke 1. Also, when you make the loop at the end of the last stroke, be sure to make it wider than it is tall, as shown here."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ha.png"">"
ひ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_hi.mp3]	hi		"The biggest problem students have with <i>hi</i> is they always make the loop too sharp at the bottom. Keep the loop nice and open. Also, notice that the entire character lists to the side. You definitely don&rsquo;t want to make this character look like a U with wings. Lean it slightly to the right."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_hi.png"">"
ふ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_fu.mp3]	fu		Think of Mount Fuji when writing the character <i>fu</i>. It should basically fit inside the shape of a triangle.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_fu.png"">"
へ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_he.mp3]	he		It&rsquo;s pretty hard to go wrong on <i>he</i>. Just make the downstroke about twice as long as the upstroke.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_he.png"">"
ほ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ho.mp3]	ho		"Notice the even spacing of the elements on the right side of <i>ho</i>. And of course, watch the <i>hane</i> and the loop as I mentioned for <i>ha</i>."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ho.png"">"
ま	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ma.mp3]	ma		"My comments on <i>ma</i> are exactly the same as those for <i>ho</i>. If you take notice again of the even spacing of the elements in this character, you won&rsquo;t make it too elongated."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ma.png"">"
み	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_mi.mp3]	mi		<i>Mi</i> looks bad if you don&rsquo;t make the horizontal stroke long enough. Keep the loop open and then draw the arch way over to the right.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_mi.png"">"
む	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_mu.mp3]	mu		"To keep <i>mu</i> looking sharp, give it a nice wide base, like a travel coffee <b>mu</b>g."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_mu.png"">"
め	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_me.mp3]	me		"The only thing to watch out for on <i>me</i> is that the second stroke crosses the first twice, as I&rsquo;ve indicated."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_me.png"">"
も	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_mo.mp3]	mo		"Looking at my drawing here, you should be able to see the energy leaving stroke one and pointing toward the first horizontal stroke. <i>Mo</i> looks great when you veer the end of stroke one off to the northwest as I&rsquo;ve shown."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_mo.png"">"
や	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ya.mp3]	ya		"Notice that in <i>ya</i>, the first and last strokes are perpendicular where they cross. But the cross that is formed is not standing straight up. It&rsquo;s really important to make it lean back like this."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ya.png"">"
ゆ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_yu.mp3]	yu		<i>Yu</i> looks really good when you keep fluid as you write it. Notice how the end of stroke one leads right up into the next stroke. Many people even make the whole character into one long stroke by drawing along the path I&rsquo;ve shown here. You may write it whichever way you like.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_yu.png"">"
よ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_yo.mp3]	yo		"The advice I gave regarding the loops in <i>ha</i>, <i>ho</i>, and <i>ma</i> also holds true here. The only other piece of wisdom I can offer is to make sure that the first stroke and the very end of the second stroke stick out about the same length."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_yo.png"">"
ら	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ra.mp3]	ra		"My comments on <i>ra</i> are similar to those for <i>chi</i>. After you start the second stroke, be sure to come slightly up and over where the arrow shows."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ra.png"">"
り	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ri.mp3]	ri		"With <i>ri</i>, just watch the <i>hane</i> at the end of stroke 1."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ri.png"">"
る	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ru.mp3]	ru		Check out how long the red portion of <i>ru</i> is here. It comes further to the left than any other part of the character. Be sure to give this line its full value.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ru.png"">"
れ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_re.mp3]	re		"This character looks an awful lot like <i>ne</i>, but without the loop. Emphasize the difference by making the final stroke come down strong with a little curl at the end."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_re.png"">"
ろ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ro.mp3]	ro		"It&rsquo;s hard to go wrong with this one, but avoid making it look like a 3 by keeping the upper right corner sharp."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_ro.png"">"
わ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_wa.mp3]	wa		"<i>Wa</i> looks exactly the same as <i>ne</i>, only without the final loop. It&rsquo;s also similar in shape to <i>re</i>. Differentiate it by keeping it nice and open, with plenty of air inside."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_wa.png"">"
を	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_(w)o.mp3]	(w)o	1	"As strange as this character looks, it&rsquo;s not difficult to write. It might help to imagine it as a hybrid of <i>n</i> and <i>to</i>."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_wo.png"">"
ん	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_n.mp3]	n		Don&rsquo;t deny it. I know you&rsquo;re thinking that this looks like an <i>h</i>. And that&rsquo;s just how you should write it. Just be sure to make it an <u>italic</u> <i>h</i>.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_hiragana_n.png"">"

ク	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ku.mp3]	ku		"Here we have two instances of the &ldquo;katakana curve&rdquo; in a single character. If you can master this curve, your characters will look great."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_ku.png"">"
ケ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ke.mp3]	ke		"Obviously, <i>ke</i> differs from <i>ku</i> in that the second stroke is longer.

コ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ko.mp3]	ko		"It&rsquo;s subtle in this font, but in <i>ko</i>, as in <i>e</i>, the character is slightly wider than it is tall."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_ko.png"">"
サ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_sa.mp3]	sa		"Be careful with <i>sa</i>, as it looks a lot like the hiragana character <i>se</i>."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_sa.png"">"
シ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_shi.mp3]	shi		"The last stroke in this character <strong>must</strong> be written from the bottom up.

"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_shi.png"">"
ス	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_su.mp3]	su		"If you find it easier, most people write <i>su</i> using all straight lines. There&rsquo;s no need to curve the end of the first stroke."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_su.png"">"
セ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_se.mp3]	se		Don&rsquo;t skimp on that <i>hane</i> at the end of the first stroke. Give it the same oomph you might use when finishing off a check mark and you&rsquo;ll have a great looking <i>se</i>.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_se.png"">"
ソ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_so.mp3]	so		Make <i>so</i> look different from <i>shi</i> by emphasizing the fact that both elements in this character point down to the ground. The second stroke must start from the top.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_so.png"">"
タ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ta.mp3]	ta		<i>Ta</i> doesn&rsquo;t present many challenges. Just get that nice &ldquo;katakana curve&rdquo; in there.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_ta.png"">"
チ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_chi.mp3]	chi		"In <i>chi</i>, the first stroke starts from the right and goes down and hard to the left, which is very unusual. As a general rule, all strokes go from left to right, and from top to bottom, so you need to remember that this character is special. Also notice that the last stroke pulls straight down, then curves at the end."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_chi.png"">"
ツ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tsu.mp3]	tsu		"To remember the difference between <i>tsu</i> and <i>so</i>, it might be helpful to remind yourself that <i>tsu</i> has &ldquo;tsu&rdquo; (two) short strokes at the beginning instead of just one.

テ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_te.mp3]	te		"Keep <i>te</i> and <i>chi</i> straight by remembering the two main differences: The first two strokes in <i>te</i> are parallel, and the third stroke doesn&rsquo;t go all the way through, as it does in <i>chi</i>."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_te.png"">"
ト	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_to.mp3]	to		<i>To</i> is easy. Just keep the first stroke vertical and you&rsquo;ll be fine.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_to.png"">"
ナ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_na.mp3]	na		Be sure to intersect the first stroke of <i>na</i> in the center.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_na.png"">"
ニ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ni.mp3]	ni		"You can remember <i>ni</i> because it has two horizontal lines, and <i>ni</i> is the word for &ldquo;two.&rdquo;"	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_ni.png"">"
ヌ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_nu.mp3]	nu		This character is basically a <i>ta</i> without the first stroke.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_nu.png"">"
ネ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ne.mp3]	ne		<i>Ne</i> will look a lot more balanced if you think of the third stroke as a central support pole around which the rest of the character should be distributed evenly.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_ne.png"">"
ノ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_no.mp3]	no		<i>No</i> is easy to remember because &ldquo;no&rdquo; other lines attach to it.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_no.png"">"
ハ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ha.mp3]	ha		Don&rsquo;t let these strokes connect at the top.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_ha.png"">"
ヒ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_hi.mp3]	hi		Make sure that second stroke forms a solid 90-degree elbow in <i>hi</i>.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_hi.png"">"
フ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_fu.mp3]	fu		"It&rsquo;s important with <i>fu</i> that you don&rsquo;t make the curved part straight. In other words, don&rsquo;t make it look like a 7. It also helps to keep it slightly wider than it is tall."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_fu.png"">"

マ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ma.mp3]	ma		"When I was learning this syllabary, it helped me to write <i>ma</i> correctly if I imagined it as a triangular flag on a stick, leaning back at a 45-degree angle."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_ma.png"">"
ミ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_mi.mp3]	mi		"This character might make more sense after you learn another way to say the number three: <i>mittsu</i>.

ム	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_mu.mp3]	mu		It&rsquo;s hard to go wrong with <i>mu</i>. Just keep that first stroke to about a 45-degree angle and it&rsquo;ll look great.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_mu.png"">"
メ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_me.mp3]	me		"This one is nice and easy. Just be sure to get that gentle ""katakana curve"" in, and make the strokes different lengths so it doesn&rsquo;t look like an X, and you&rsquo;ll be fine."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_me.png"">"
モ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_mo.mp3]	mo		"<i>Mo</i> also looks a lot like its cousin. Notice, however, that the stroke order is different. (In the hiragana <i>mo</i>, the vertical line comes first.)"	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_mo.png"">"
ヤ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ya.mp3]	ya		"This character looks just like its cousin, except it&rsquo;s more angular and it&rsquo;s missing a stroke.

ユ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_yu.mp3]	yu		"Above all else, make sure that the vertical portion of the first stroke in <i>yu</i> goes straight down or veers a little to the left. It should not go to the right."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_yu.png"">"
ヨ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_yo.mp3]	yo		It&rsquo;s a backwards &ldquo;E.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s all it is. Write it like that and you&rsquo;ll have no problems.

ラ	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ra.mp3]	ra		"This character is simply a <i>fu</i> with a line on top, but since <i>fu</i> and <i>ra</i> should take up the same vertical space, you&rsquo;ll need to compress the <i>fu</i> part a bit."	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_ra.png"">"

ル	[sound:7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_ru.mp3]	ru		The end of stroke two in <i>ru</i> is nothing more than a glorified <i>hane</i>. Flick the pencil up like you&rsquo;re making a check mark and it&rsquo;ll look perfect.	"<img src=""7biey7947yx7iz074op63ck7x_tips_katakana_ru.png"">"
