**Note:** Reposition only. Do not randomize.

This deck is designed in a way that each note is related to the next, treating
the resulting chains as enumerations instead. Each is tested via overlapping
cloze deletions. This should help the material to stick much better.

See, <https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules#Enumerations>

## Setup

First, make sure to import every data sheet, every data sheet chunk, and place
them all in one deck. Next, set "Default Due" as the "Sort Field" and then sort
by that instead.

Now, simply select all and reposition, and you're done. No need to perform some
complex repositioning queries.

After all that, if you want to, you can set the "Sort Field" back to "Serial"
-- the first field.
