**Note:** Reposition only. Do not randomize.

This deck is designed in a way that each note is related to the next, treating
the resulting chains as enumerations instead. Each is tested via overlapping
cloze deletions. This should help the material to stick much better.

See, <https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules#Enumerations>

## Preparation

First, make sure to import every data sheet, for every note type, and place
them all in one deck. Next, set "Default Due" as the "Sort Field" and then sort
by that instead.
